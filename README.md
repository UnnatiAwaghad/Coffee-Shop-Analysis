I recently completed a project where I analyzed coffee shop sales data using data visualization techniques in Python . This project helped uncover sales trends, top-selling products, and more, providing valuable insights for better business decisions.

🔍 Key Insights from Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis:
📈 Top-Selling Categories: Coffee and Bakery items lead in total sales.
🏙️ Best-Performing Stores: Urban locations showed the highest sales volume.
📅 Sales Trends: Weekends see a significant spike in transactions.
💡 Customer Preferences: Seasonal products like flavored drinks perform well during holidays.
